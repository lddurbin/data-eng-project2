        The Metropolitan Museum of Art presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy.
        The Museum lives in two iconic sites in New York Cityâ€”The Met Fifth Avenue and The Met Cloisters. Millions of people also take part in The Met experience online.
        Since it was founded in 1870, The Met has always aspired to be more than a treasury of rare and beautiful objects.
        Every day, art comes alive in the Museum's galleries and through its exhibitions and events, revealing both new ideas and unexpected connections across time and across cultures.
        The Metropolitan Museum of Art provides select datasets of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use.
